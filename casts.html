            <h2>ADRIAN MARTH</h2>
            <br>
            <p>No need to say how much we like the vibe of Italo Moderni and Adrian Marth. The barcelona's based capo,
              big fan of synths, EBM and Newbeat; has been building recently a solid spot on the scene, being a big
              influence for dj's who focus their sound on the Italo era.In this new cast, Adrian Marth dig on his huge
              vinyl collection delivering a very special mix where (of course) "Italo-Disco" will be the leitmotiv of
              the story. It's getting dark, time to use your sunglases at night.</p>

            <h2>STATUES</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We started following Statues since we discovered this little gem that is "River Darkness" included in the
              mighty compilation done by "Claremont 56" for his Ten Anniversary. From that moment on we've always had an
              ear under every release or mix that comes from Statues Collective. Statues has gained a well deserved
              place on the scene delivering excellent works that have find a place on Eclectics. Is it Balearic? and the
              mentioned Claremont 56; and being remixed by some MM Discos favourites like Coyote, Gold Suite or The
              Vendtetta Suit among many others.</p>
