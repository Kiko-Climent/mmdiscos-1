# MM DISCOS
MM Discos is an independent record label founded in 2015 and runned by Da Silva and Dj Katah. Based currently between Berlin and Barcelona, the primary goal of the label appears to be supporting and promoting emerging artists, helping them gain exposure and recognition in the music industry. MM Discos achieves this by releasing original productions from these artists and by hosting podcast DJ sets, which can help showcase their talents and connect them with a wider audience.

### Features Left to Implement
- I'm interested in expanding our website by incorporating a couple of new pages. Firstly, I'd like to create a dedicated page showcasing our merchandise, including items like t-shirts, slipmats, and tote bags. Secondly, I'm considering a separate page to highlight our second label, co-owned by myself and my partner, Vitor.

## Credits
MM Discos, co-owned by my partner Vitor Silva and me, holds all copyrights for songs and artwork images. The text content used on our website comprises descriptions found on our social media profiles.

In the process of creating our record label's website, I sought inspiration from various independent record labels. Notable influences include:

- [Permanent Vacation](https://perm-vac.com/): I was drawn to the concept of framing release images and the minimalist design.

- [Gudu Records](https://peggygou.com/gudu-records)

- [Claremont 56](https://www.claremont56.com/)

The idea to place the navigation bar within the header was suggested by my friend and fellow programmer, Javier Fernande Heras.

As for the footer design, I found inspiration in the one we previously used for the _**Love Running Project.**_ Its functional and straightforward nature perfectly suited my vision for our record label's website
