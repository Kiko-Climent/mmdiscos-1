# MM DISCOS 

MM Discos is an independent record label founded in 2015 and runned by Da Silva and Dj Katah. Based currently between Berlin and Barcelona, the primary goal of the label appears to be supporting and promoting emerging artists, helping them gain exposure and recognition in the music industry. MM Discos achieves this by releasing original productions from these artists and by hosting podcast DJ sets, which can help showcase their talents and connect them with a wider audience.

## DESIGN

### Colour Scheme
MM Discos draws its musical inspiration primarily from the Balearic movement that emerged during the late 1980s and early 1990s. We explore a wide range of music genres, spanning from Disco to House and everything in between. Yet, it's important to note that our unique sound would not exist without the influence of the Ibicenco Scene. We constantly keep the image of this small island in mind, with its vibrant colors evoking the elements of water, sun, sky, and sand, which shape our musical identity.

### Typography
To keep things simple, I've opted for a single font: 'Montserrat.' This font was selected for its clean and understated style. Its name also holds a connection to one of Barcelona's famous mountains, evoking the constant presence of the Mediterranean Sea in our thoughts.

### Features Left to Implement
I'm interested in expanding our website by incorporating two new pages. Firstly, I'd like to create a dedicated page showcasing our merchandise, including items like t-shirts, slipmats, and tote bags. Secondly, I'm considering a separate page to highlight our second label, co-owned by myself and my partner, Vitor.

## Testing

### Validator Testing
- HTML:
I found an error because there was some buttons nested inside < a > elements. I fixed the problems by creating new buttons with Bootstrap.
Passing again through the validator and no more errors were found [W3C Validator] ()

- CSS:
No errors were found after passing through the official [Jigsaw Validator]()


## Deployment
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits
MM Discos, co-owned by my partner Vitor Silva and me, holds all copyrights for songs and artwork images. The text content used on our website comprises descriptions found on our social media profiles.

In the process of creating our record label's website, I sought inspiration from various independent record labels. Notable influences include:

- [Permanent Vacation](https://perm-vac.com/): I was drawn to the concept of framing release images and the minimalist design.

- [Gudu Records](https://peggygou.com/gudu-records)

- [Claremont 56](https://www.claremont56.com/)

The idea to place the navigation bar within the header was suggested by my friend and fellow programmer, Javier Fernande Heras.

As for the footer design, I found inspiration in the one we previously used for the _**Love Running Project.**_ Its functional and straightforward nature perfectly suited my vision for our record label's website.

To create the Readme.md file, I consulted and adhered to the guidelines provided by _*The Love Running Project*_ and also drew inspiration from _*Found in Translation*_ by Kera Kudmore.

The icons featured in the footer section and the mobile-friendly _Hamburger menu_ implemented in the navigation bar for smaller devices were crafted by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

The Favicon used was generated with the help of [Favicon](https://favicon.io/)

"I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create the buttons labeled 'Listen on SoundCloud' and 'Buy on Bandcamp' on my website. Additionally, I found [Kiko Palomares](https://www.youtube.com/@kikopalomares) tutorials on YouTube to be extremely valuable while I was developing my site."
